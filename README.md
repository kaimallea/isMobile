# isMobile

A simple JS library that detects mobile devices.



_Big thanks to [Igor Ribeio Lima](https://github.com/igorlima) for his contributions._

## Why use isMobile?

I had a specific requirement for a project when I created this:

**`- Redirect all iPhones, iPods, Android phones, and seven inch devices to the mobile site.`**

A completely separate site had been created for mobile devices, so feature detection/graceful degredation/progressive enhancement were out of the question. I had to redirect.

I couldn't do detection on the back-end, because the entire site was cached and served by Akamai; I had to do the detection client-side.

So I resorted to UA sniffing.

I tried to keep the script small (**currently ~740 bytes, minified**) and simple, because it would need to execute in the `<head>`, which is generally a bad idea, since JS blocks downloading and rendering of anything else while it parses and executes. In the case of mobile redirection, I don't mind so much, because I want to start the redirect as soon as possible, before the device has a chance to start downloading and rendering stuff. For non-mobile platforms, the script should execute fast, so the browser can quickly get back to downloading and rendering.

## How it works

isMobile runs quickly on page load to detect mobile devices; it then creates a JavaScript object with the results.

## Devices detected by isMobile

The following properies of the `isMobile` object will either be `true` or `false`

### Apple devices

* `isMobile.apple.phone`
* `isMobile.apple.ipod`
* `isMobile.apple.tablet`
* `isMobile.apple.device` (any mobile Apple device)

### Android devices

* `isMobile.android.phone`
* `isMobile.android.tablet`
* `isMobile.android.device` (any mobile Android device)

### Windows devices

* `isMobile.windows.phone`
* `isMobile.windows.tablet`
* `isMobile.windows.device` (any mobile Windows device)

### Specific seven inch devices

* `isMobile.seven_inch`
	* `true` if the device is one of the following 7" devices:
		- Nexus 7
		- Kindle Fire
		- Nook Tablet 7 inch
		- Galaxy Tab 7 inch

### "Other" devices

* `isMobile.other_blackberry`
* `isMobile.other_opera` (Opera Mini)
* `isMobile.other_firefox`

### Aggregate Groupings

* `isMobile.any` - any device matched
* `isMobile.phone` - any device in the 'phone' groups above
* `isMobile.tablet` - any device in the 'tablet' groups above


## Example Usage

I include the minified version of the script, inline, and at the top of the `<head>`. Cellular connections tend to suck, so it would be wasteful overhead to open another connection, just to download <1kb of JS:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script>
        // Minified version of isMobile included in the HTML since it's <1kb
        (function(i){var e=/iPhone/i,n=/iPod/i,o=/iPad/i,t=/(?=.*\bAndroid\b)(?=.*\bMobile\b)/i,r=/Android/i,d=/BlackBerry/i,s=/Opera Mini/i,a=/IEMobile/i,b=/(?=.*\bFirefox\b)(?=.*\bMobile\b)/i,h=RegExp("(?:Nexus 7|BNTV250|Kindle Fire|Silk|GT-P1000)","i"),c=function(i,e){return i.test(e)},l=function(i){var l=i||navigator.userAgent;this.apple={phone:c(e,l),ipod:c(n,l),tablet:c(o,l),device:c(e,l)||c(n,l)||c(o,l)},this.android={phone:c(t,l),tablet:!c(t,l)&&c(r,l),device:c(t,l)||c(r,l)},this.other={blackberry:c(d,l),opera:c(s,l),windows:c(a,l),firefox:c(b,l),device:c(d,l)||c(s,l)||c(a,l)||c(b,l)},this.seven_inch=c(h,l),this.any=this.apple.device||this.android.device||this.other.device||this.seven_inch},v=i.isMobile=new l;v.Class=l})(window);


        // My own arbitrary use of isMobile, as an example
        (function () {
            var MOBILE_SITE = '/mobile/index.html', // site to redirect to
                NO_REDIRECT = 'noredirect'; // cookie to prevent redirect

            // I only want to redirect iPhones, Android phones and a handful of 7" devices
            if (isMobile.apple.phone || isMobile.android.phone || isMobile.seven_inch) {

                // Only redirect if the user didn't previously choose
                // to explicitly view the full site. This is validated
                // by checking if a "noredirect" cookie exists
                if ( document.cookie.indexOf(NO_REDIRECT) === -1 ) {
                    document.location = MOBILE_SITE;
                }
            }
        })();
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- imagine lots of html and content -->
</body>
</html>
```
